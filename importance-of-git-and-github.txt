 Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them. Both Git and GitHub give programmers valuable version-control functionality so that they can build ongoing coding projects without being afraid of messing everything up. GitHub just takes things a little bit further than Git, offering more functionality and resources, as well as a place online to store and collaborate on projects.
